This is a simple Arduino library for interfacing an Arduino with a Logitech F710 controller using a USB Host Shield. 

The Logitech F710 is a common wireless handheld USB HID controller that is useful for remote control projects.

Arduino retired their USB Host Shield product, but plenty of generic copies are still available online with other distributors.
